zFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a
footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was
in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at
the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large
eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.
She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
zThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a
great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over
to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, «For the Duchess. An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet.» The Frog-Footman
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of
the words a little, «From the Queen. An invitation for the
Duchess to play croquet.»
zThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
together.
zAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped
out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
zAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
z«There's no sort of use in knocking,» said the Footman, «and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on
the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one
could possibly hear you.» And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a
constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been
broken to pieces.
z«Please, then,» said Alice, «how am I to get in?»
